This test was created for question 2.1 in HW01.

#files:
1. "mergeSortedListsTest.c"
2. "expected_output.txt"

Instructions:
1. Unpack the files to folder.
2. Copy your own implementation of question 2.1 to the designated areas in "mergeSortedListsTest.c".
3. Insert your functions names into designated areas in the main function
4. Build and run on server/PC and compare your output to "expected_output.txt".

Sidenote:
My declaration of the createNode function is "Node createNode(int value)",
if your function creates Nodes diffrently adjust accordingly.
